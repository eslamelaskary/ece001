    <td>Robotic process automation is being applied to highly repetitive tasks normally performed by humans. Machine learning algorithms are being integrated 
into analytics and CRM (Customer relationship management) platforms to uncover information on how to better serve customers. Chatbots have already been
incorporated into websites and e companies to provide immediate service to customers. Automation of job positions has also become a talking point among academics
and IT consultancies.</td>
    <td>Companies are applying machine learning to make better and faster diagnoses than humans. One of the best-known technologies is IBM’s Watson. It 
understands natural language and can respond to questions asked of it. The system mines patient data and other available data sources to form a hypothesis, 
which it then presents with a confidence scoring schema. AI is a study realized to emulate human intelligence into computer technology that could assist both,
the doctor and the patients in the following ways:By providing a laboratory for the examination, representation and cataloguing medical information and By 
devising novel tool to support decision making and research</td> 
    <td>It automates grading, giving educators more time.It can also assess students and adapt to their needs, helping them work at their own pace...etc.</td>

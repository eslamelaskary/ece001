<h2>Advantages of Artificial Intelligence</h2>
1.AI doesn’t get tired and wear out easily:<br>
Artificial Intelligence and the science of robotics is used in mining and other fuel exploration processes. These complex machines help to explore the ocean 
floor and overcome human limitations. Due to the programming of the robots, they can perform a more laborious task with extra hard work and with greater 
responsibility. Moreover, they do not wear out easily.<br>
2.Repetitive jobs:<br>
The same old task, a task that doesn’t add value is of no use. Also, repetitive jobs are monotonous in nature and can be carried out with the help of machine 
intelligence. Machines think faster than humans and can perform various functions at the same time. It can be employed to carry out dangerous tasks and its 
parameters are adjusted. This is not possible with humans as their speed and time can’t be calculated on the basis of parameters.<br>
3.Implementing AI in risky situations:<br>
Human safety is taken care of by machines. Safety is vulnerable and with machines that are fitted with predefined algorithms, this can be used. Scientists use
complex machines to study the ocean floor where human survival becomes difficult. This is the level of AI. It reaches the place where humans can’t reach. Thus,
 helps to solve issues in a jiffy.<br>

<h2>Disadvantages of Artificial Intelligence</h2>
1.High cost:<br>
It’s true that AI comes with a high cost, but there is no such thing as a free lunch too. It requires huge costs as it is a complex machine. Apart from the 
installation cost, its repair and maintenance also require huge costs. The software programs need frequent upgradation and cater to the needs of the changing 
environment.<br>
2.Creativity is not the key for AI:<br>
Machines can’t be creative. They can only do what they are being taught or commanded. Though they help in designing and creating, they can’t match the power 
of a human brain. Humans are sensitive and intellectuals and they are very creative too. They can generate ideas, can think out of the box. They see, hear, 
think and feel which machine can’t. Their thoughts are guided by the feelings which completely lacks in machines. No matter how much a machine outgrows, it 
can’t inherent intuitive abilities of the human brain and can’t replicate it.<br>
3.No human replication:<br>
No matter how smart a machine becomes, it can never replicate a human. Machines are rational but, very inhuman as they don’t possess emotions and moral values. 
They don’t know what is ethical and what’s legal and because of this, don’t have their own judgment making skills. They do what they are told to do and 
therefore the judgment of right or wrong is nil for them. If they encounter a situation that is unfamiliar to them then they perform incorrectly or else break 
down in such situations.

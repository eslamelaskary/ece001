<img src="types-of-artificial-intelligence.png" alt="types of Artificial intelligence"><br>

1.Narrow AI:<br>
is a type of AI which is able to perform a dedicated task with intelligence.The most common and currently available AI is Narrow AI in the world of Artificial Intelligence.
Narrow AI cannot perform beyond its field or limitations, as it is only trained for one specific task. Hence it is also termed as weak AI. Narrow AI can fail in unpredictable ways if it goes beyond its limits.<br>
2.General AI:<br>
is a type of intelligence which could perform any intellectual task with efficiency like a human.The idea behind the general AI to make such a system which could be smarter and think like a human by its own.<br>
3.Super AI:<br>
is a level of Intelligence of Systems at which machines could surpass human intelligence, and can perform any task better than human with cognitive properties. It is an outcome of general AI.Super AI is still a hypothetical concept of Artificial Intelligence. Development of such systems in real is still world changing task.<br>
4.Reactive Machines:<br>
Purely reactive machines are the most basic types of Artificial Intelligence.Such AI systems do not store memories or past experiences for future actions.These machines only focus on current scenarios and react on it as per possible best action.<br>
5.Limited Memory:<br>
Limited memory machines can store past experiences or some data for a short period of time.These machines can use stored data for a limited time period only.<br>
6.Theory of Mind:<br>
Theory of Mind AI should understand the human emotions, people, beliefs, and be able to interact socially like humans.This type of AI machines are still not developed, but researchers are making lots of efforts and improvement for developing such AI machines.<br>
7.Self-Awareness:<br>
Self-awareness AI is the future of Artificial Intelligence. These machines will be super intelligent, and will have their own consciousness, sentiments, and self-awareness.These machines will be smarter than human mind.<br>
